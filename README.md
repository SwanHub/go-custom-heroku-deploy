# First Custom Go App on Heroku
- The purpose of this application is to create a simple single-model app with CRUD and deploy to Heroku, connecting to remote postgres database.
- I'm starting with the tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uey7jIEmR3A&t=595s
- I will then merge the deployed heroku app with this repository's ORM work: https://github.com/SwanHub/Go-ORMs
